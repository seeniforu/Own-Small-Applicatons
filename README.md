# Own-Small-Applicatons

## Original Cleaner

Hi Guys, Created Small application to Clean Temp Files Just by Double Clicking it. (Especially for Those who hesitate to use Third party apps)

It'll Do Following Actions (**CMD Windows May Pops-up**, Don't Panic ðŸ˜‚)
  
  - It'll Clean Temp Files Created By User.
  - It'll Clean Temp Files Created By Windows.
  - It'll Clean DNS History Cache also. 

You can use it,

  - After browsing Long time in Internet.
  - When you feel System is Bit slow.

If I found new way to clear Cache and Temp Items, I'll Update in My Application.

### How to use... 

**Download the [Exe file](https://github.com/seeniforu/Own-Small-Applicatons/blob/main/Original%20Cleaner/cleaner.exe), Just Double Click the and Give "Yes"**. That's it.

## Hide and Un-hide Items 

Points to remember :

- **Default password is 'hello'** - will Work on everyone having their own password.
- **File Name is Important. 
- Once you Hide the file and need to Unhide it **Name of the File is Must**. User need to Type the complete filename with Extension to Unhide it.

Executable file size maybe High.
